# Notes 
### Acknowledgment
This is version 2.0 of the SIR-model and report. It incorporates the following recommendations from Professor Dieter Suess. 

1. The assumption of no new vaccinations is explicitly stated now.
    For reasons of simplicity the daily vaccinations that were actually administered were left out.
    A simple approach to modelling these vaccinations was tried anyways. 
    
2. The immunity level (= former vaccination efficacy) is now implemented correctly and the formulae 
   have been corrected. There is indeed a 80% level of immunity in fully immune people.
