### Notes: 
- The official time series data (BMSGPK, 2021) had a missing row on November 14th, 2021 so this datapoint was interpolated.
- The data from [timeline-faelle-ems_period_simple.csv](./timeline-faelle-ems_period_simple.csv) was used to plot the real world data against the simulated results.
